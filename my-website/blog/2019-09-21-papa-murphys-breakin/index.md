# Local Papa Murphy's Store Targeted in Overnight Break-In

*September 22, 2019 â€” Calgary, Alberta*

In the early hours of Thursday morning, a local Papa Murphy's Pizza location became the target of a suspicious break-in, authorities reported. The incident occurred around 2:30 AM, when unknown individuals forcibly entered the establishment, causing significant damage to the property.

## Details of the Incident

According to the Calgary Police Department, the perpetrators threw large rocks at the building, smashing several windows before gaining access to the store. Surveillance cameras captured blurred images of the suspects fleeing the scene with what appears to be electronic equipment, along with the tip jar being smashed and emptied, although no food items were reported missing.

"I was driving by around 3 AM and saw the lights on inside Papa Murphy's. It looked suspicious, so I called 911," said Jordan Lee, a witness to the event. "When the police arrived, the suspects had already left. It's concerning because it's not just property damage; it feels like a violation of our community's safety."



The break-in has left the Papa Murphy's franchise temporarily closed as management assesses the damage and reviews security protocols. Employees returned to an empty storefront to find shattered glass and signs of forced entry. Fortunately, no employees were present during the incident, so no injuries have been reported.

"We're devastated by what happened," said Maria Gonzalez, the store manager. "Our team is safe, and thankfully, there were no physical injuries. We're cooperating fully with the authorities to ensure that our store can reopen as soon as possible and that measures are put in place to prevent future incidents."



Local businesses and residents have expressed shock and concern over the break-in, emphasizing the need for increased security measures in the area. The Papa Murphy's franchise has scheduled a meeting next week to discuss strategies for enhancing safety and preventing similar incidents.

Mayor Naheed Nenshi also addressed the community, assuring citizens that the city is taking the incident seriously. "We are committed to ensuring the safety and security of all our businesses and residents. Our police force is investigating this matter thoroughly, and we will implement additional measures as needed to protect our community."


Police investigators are reviewing surveillance footage and interviewing potential witnesses to identify those responsible for the break-in. While no arrests have been made at this time, authorities are confident that they will bring the perpetrators to justice.

"We urge anyone with information about this incident to come forward," stated Officer Emily Carter of the Calgary Police Department. "Even minor details can be crucial in solving cases like this."


The Papa Murphy's community is rallying together to support the affected store. Local residents have organized a fundraiser to help cover repair costs and assist the business in its recovery efforts. "It's important that we stand by our local businesses during these challenging times," Gonzalez added. "The support from our community means the world to us."

As the investigation continues, the hope is that the community will come together to enhance security and prevent future incidents, ensuring that businesses like Papa Murphy's can thrive without fear.
